abstract: BACKGROUND Early discontinuation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is common
  and leads to poor outcomes but is challenging to predict. In the Exemestane and
  Letrozole Pharmacogenetics trial, a high rate of early discontinuation due to intolerance
  was observed. We hypothesized that early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
  predict AI discontinuation and that biochemical factors are associated with changes
  in PROs. PATIENTS AND METHODS Postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer
  enrolled in a prospective randomized trial of exemestane versus letrozole completed
  questionnaires at baseline and serially over 24 months to assess overall quality
  of life (EuroQOL Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); mood; and multiple symptoms, including
  a musculoskeletal symptom cluster. A joint mixed-effects/survival model was used
  to estimate the effect of the change in PROs on AI discontinuation. Associations
  between biochemical factors and change in PROs were examined. RESULTS A total of
  490 patients were analyzed. Worsening of EuroQOL VAS and the musculoskeletal cluster
  were associated with the highest risk for early discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR],
  2.77 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-2.81; p = .015]; HR, 4.39 [95% CI, 2.40-8.02;
  p textless .0001], respectively). Pharmacokinetics and estrogen metabolism were
  not consistently associated with change in PRO measures. No clinically significant
  differences in any PRO between AIs were observed. CONCLUSION Changes in PROs early
  during AI therapy were associated with treatment discontinuation. Identification
  of these changes could be used to target interventions in patients at high risk
  for early discontinuation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early changes in patient-reported
  outcomes (PROs) can predict nonpersistence to aromatase inhibitor therapy. If used
  in clinical practice, PROs might identify women at highest risk for early discontinuation
  and allow for interventions to improve tolerance before significant toxicities develop.
  Further research is needed to improve capturing PROs in routine clinical practice.
