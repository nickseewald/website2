abstract: "Target trial emulation is an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental
  studies by ``emulating'' key features of a clinical trial. Most commonly used outside
  of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies
  typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the application
  of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation context. The policy
  trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units and eligibility criteria,
  definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, assignment mechanism, baseline
  (``time zero'') and follow-up, outcomes, causal estimand, and statistical analysis
  and assumptions. Policy evaluations that emulate a randomized trial across these
  dimensions can yield estimates of the causal effects of the policy on outcomes.
  Using the policy trial emulation framework to conduct and report on research design
  and methods supports transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental
  studies intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population
  health outcomes."
