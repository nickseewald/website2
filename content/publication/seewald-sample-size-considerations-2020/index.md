abstract: Clinicians and researchers alike are increasingly interested in how best
  to personalize interventions. A dynamic treatment regimen is a sequence of prespecified
  decision rules which can be used to guide the delivery of a sequence of treatments
  or interventions that is tailored to the changing needs of the individual. The sequential
  multiple-assignment randomized trial is a research tool which allows for the construction
  of effective dynamic treatment regimens. We derive easy-to-use formulae for computing
  the total sample size for three common two-stage sequential multiple-assignment
  randomized trial designs in which the primary aim is to compare mean end-of-study
  outcomes for two embedded dynamic treatment regimens which recommend different first-stage
  treatments. The formulae are derived in the context of a regression model which
  leverages information from a longitudinal outcome collected over the entire study.
  We show that the sample size formula for a sequential multiple-assignment randomized
  trial can be written as the product of the sample size formula for a standard two-arm
  randomized trial, a deflation factor that accounts for the increased statistical
  efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation factor that
  accounts for the design of a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial. The
  sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial design inflation factor is typically
  a function of the anticipated probability of response to first-stage treatment.
  We review modeling and estimation for dynamic treatment regimen effect analyses
  using a longitudinal outcome from a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial,
  as well as the estimation of standard errors. We also present estimators for the
  covariance matrix for a variety of common working correlation structures. Methods
  are motivated using the ENGAGE study, a sequential multiple-assignment randomized
  trial aimed at developing a dynamic treatment regimen for increasing motivation
  to attend treatments among alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients.
