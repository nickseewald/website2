abstract: This study uses Texas's 2017 integration of the state disability and mental
  health agencies as a case study, combining interviews with Texas agency and advocacy
  organization leaders to examine perceptions of agency integration and augmented
  synthetic control analyses of 2014--2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to examine
  impacts on mental health service use among individuals with co-occurring cognitive
  disabilities (including intellectual and developmental disabilities) and mental
  health conditions. Interviewees described the intensive process of agency integration
  and identified primarily positive (e.g., decreased administrative burden) impacts
  of integration. Quantitative analyses indicated no effects of integration on receipt
  of mental health-related services among people with co-occurring conditions. While
  leaders identified some potentially beneficial impacts of state agency integration,
  the limited impact of integration beyond the agency suggests that interventions
  at multiple levels of the service system, including those targeting providers, are
  needed to better meet the mental health service needs for this population.
