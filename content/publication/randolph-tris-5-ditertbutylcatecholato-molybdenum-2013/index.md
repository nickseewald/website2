abstract: In the solid state, tris(3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato)molybdenum(VI) forms
  a dimer with seven-coordinate molybdenum and bridging catecholates. NMR spectroscopy
  indicates that the dimeric structure is retained in solution. The molybdenum center
  has a high affinity for Lewis bases such as pyridine or pyridine-N-oxide, forming
  seven-coordinate monomers with a capped octahedral geometry, as illustrated by the
  solid-state structure of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(py). Structural data indicate that the
  complexes are best considered as Mo(VI) with substantial $Ï€$ donation from the nonbridging
  catecholates to molybdenum. Both the dimeric and the monomeric tris(catecholates)
  react rapidly with water to form free catechol and oxomolybdenum bis(catecholate)
  complexes. Monooxomolybdenum complexes are also obtained, more slowly, on reaction
  with dioxygen, with organic products consisting mostly of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone
  with minor amounts of the extradiol oxidation product 4,6-di-tert-butyl-1-oxacyclohepta-4,6-diene-2,3-dione.
  The pyridine-N-oxide complex reacts on heating (with excess pyO) to form initially
  (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy) and ultimately MoO3(Opy), with quinone and free pyridine
  as the only organic products. The decay of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy) shows an accelerated,
  autocatalytic profile because the oxidation of its product, (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy),
  produces an oxo-rich, catecholate-poor intermediate which rapidly conproportionates
  with (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy), providing an additional pathway for its conversion
  to the mono-oxo product. The tris(catecholate) fragment Mo(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3 deoxygenates
  Opy in this nonclassical oxygen atom transfer reaction slightly less rapidly than
  does its oxidized product, MoO(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2.
