abstract: The micro-randomized trial (MRT) is a new experimental design which allows
  for the investigation of the proximal effects of a ``just-in-time'' treatment, often
  provided via a mobile device as part of a mobile health intervention. As with a
  traditional randomized controlled trial, computing the minimum required sample size
  to achieve a desired power is a crucial step in designing an MRT. We present MRT-SS
  Calculator, an online sample-size calculator for micro-randomized trials, built
  with R Shiny. MRT-SS Calculator requires specification of time-varying patterns
  for the proximal treatment effect and expected treatment availability. We illustrate
  the implementation of MRTSS Calculator using a mobile health trial, HeartSteps.
  The application can be accessed from https://pengliao.shinyapps.io/mrt-calculator.
