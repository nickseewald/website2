abstract: Purpose Aromatase inhibitors (AI), which decrease circulating estradiol
  concentrations in post-menopausal women, are associated with toxicities that limit
  adherence. Approximately one-third of patients will tolerate a different AI after
  not tolerating the first. We report the effect of crossover from exemestane to letrozole
  or vice versa on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and whether the success of crossover
  is due to lack of estrogen suppression.
