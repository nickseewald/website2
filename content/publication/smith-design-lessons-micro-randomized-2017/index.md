abstract: "Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) offer promise for informing the development
  of effective mobile just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) intended to support
  individuals' health behavior change, but both their novelty and the novelty of JITAIs
  introduces new problems in implementation. An understanding of the practical challenges
  unique to rolling out MRTs and JITAIs is a prerequisite to valid empirical tests
  of such interventions. In this chapter, we relay lessons learned from the first
  MRT pilot study of HeartSteps, a JITAI intended to encourage sedentary adults to
  increase their physical activity by sending contextually-relevant, actionable activity
  suggestions and by supporting activity planning for the following day. This chapter
  outlines the lessons our study team learned from the HeartSteps pilot across four
  domains: (1) study recruitment and retention; (2) technical challenges in architecting
  a just-in-time adaptive intervention; (3) considerations of treatment delivery unique
  to JITAIs and MRTs; and (4) participant usage of and reflections on the HeartSteps
  study."
