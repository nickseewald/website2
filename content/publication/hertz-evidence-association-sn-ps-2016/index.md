abstract: 'AIMS: Validation of associations for SNPs in RAC2, NCF4 and SLC28A3, identification
  of a novel association with a TOP2B SNP and screening 23 SNPs putatively relevant
  to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.$backslash$n$backslash$nPATIENTS & METHODS:
  A total of 166 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin underwent echocardiogram,
  including 19 cases with systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction textless55%) and
  147 controls. Four high priority SNPs were tested in the primary analysis, with
  appropriate statistical correction, and 23 additional SNPs were screened in an uncorrected
  secondary analysis.$backslash$n$backslash$nRESULTS: Previously reported associations
  for RAC2, NCF4 and SLC28A3 could not be validated and a novel association with TOP2B
  was not discovered in this cohort (all p textgreater 0.05), likely due to inadequate
  power. Two SNPs were identified in the uncorrected secondary analysis including
  a protective SNP in ABCB1 (3435CtextgreaterT, p = 0.049) and a risk allele in CBR3
  (V244M, p = 0.012).$backslash$n$backslash$nCONCLUSION: The associations reported
  in prior publications and those discovered in this secondary analysis require further
  replication in independent cohorts.'
