abstract: In behavioral, educational and medical practice, interventions are often
  personalized over time using strategies that are based on individual behaviors and
  characteristics and changes in symptoms, severity, or adherence that are a result
  of one's treatment. Such strategies that more closely mimic real practice, are known
  as dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs). A sequential multiple assignment randomized
  trial (SMART) is a multi-stage trial design that can be used to construct effective
  DTRs. This article reviews a simple to use `weighted and replicated' estimation
  technique for comparing DTRs embedded in a SMART design using logistic regression
  for a binary, end-of-study outcome variable. Based on a Wald test that compares
  two embedded DTRs of interest from the `weighted and replicated' regression model,
  a sample size calculation is presented with a corresponding user-friendly applet
  to aid in the process of designing a SMART. The analytic models and sample size
  calculations are presented for three of the more commonly used two-stage SMART designs.
  Simulations for the sample size calculation show the empirical power reaches expected
  levels. A data analysis example with corresponding code is presented in the appendix
  using data from a SMART developing an effective DTR in autism.
