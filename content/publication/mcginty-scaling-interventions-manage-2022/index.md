abstract: "Policy implementation is a key component of scaling effective chronic disease
  prevention and management interventions. Policy can support scale-up by mandating
  or incentivizing intervention adoption, but enacting a policy is only the first
  step. Fully implementing a policy designed to facilitate implementation of health
  interventions often requires a range of accompanying implementation structures,
  like health IT systems, and implementation strategies, like training. Decision makers
  need to know what policies can support intervention adoption and how to implement
  those policies, but to date research on policy implementation is limited and innovative
  methodological approaches are needed. In December 2021, the Johns Hopkins ALACRITY
  Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness and the Johns Hopkins Center for
  Mental Health and Addiction Policy convened a forum of research experts to discuss
  approaches for studying policy implementation. In this report, we summarize the
  ideas that came out of the forum. First, we describe a motivating example focused
  on an Affordable Care Act Medicaid health home waiver policy used by some US states
  to support scale-up of an evidence-based integrated care model shown in clinical
  trials to improve cardiovascular care for people with serious mental illness. Second,
  we define key policy implementation components including structures, strategies,
  and outcomes. Third, we provide an overview of descriptive, predictive and associational,
  and causal approaches that can be used to study policy implementation. We conclude
  with discussion of priorities for methodological innovations in policy implementation
  research, with three key areas identified by forum experts: effect modification
  methods for making causal inferences about how policies' effects on outcomes vary
  based on implementation structures/strategies; causal mediation approaches for studying
  policy implementation mechanisms; and characterizing uncertainty in systems science
  models. We conclude with discussion of overarching methods considerations for studying
  policy implementation, including measurement of policy implementation, strategies
  for studying the role of context in policy implementation, and the importance of
  considering when establishing causality is the goal of policy implementation research."
