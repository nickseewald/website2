      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hi, I'm Nick.

I am a statistician who develops and applies statistical methodology to answer key questions in public health and medicine  through thoughtful study design and analysis combined with deep collaboration with applied scientists. My work is motivated by problems across a wide array of applications, including physical activity, oncology, and substance use and related policy, and spans the entire investigative process from formulating a research question through study design and data analysis. 

My goal is to develop statistical methods that empower scientists to make impactful contributions in their fields. My methodological work involves building tools to address important statistical issues in a way that is accessible and understandable to applied researchers. My work is primarily related to causal inference -- the use of data to make causal conclusions through precise assumptions, strong study design, and estimation techniques -- with complex repeated-measures data. 

In July 2023, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Health
Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,
working with [Elizabeth Stuart, PhD](https://www.elizabethstuart.org/) and [Beth
McGinty,
PhD](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2908/emma-beth-mcginty) on
causal inference for health policy evaluation. My PhD was supervised by [Daniel
Almirall, PhD](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dalmiral/). I joined Penn as an
Assistant Professor in September 2023.
