  abstract = {4151 Background: Pancreatic cancers (PDACs) with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs) are prognostically favorable and predict response to platinum-based treatment. Recent data suggest that these mutations may be more strongly associated with cancers arising from the body/tail (B/T) compared to the head of the pancreas (HOP). Primary tumors of the B/T are known to frequently metastasize to the peritoneum, which is thought to be largely due to anatomic location. We hypothesized that BRCA1/2 PVs may interact with tumor location in determining sites of metastatic spread. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using a database of patients with BRCA1/2 PVs and PDAC as well as wildtype (WT) control patients matched for age, sex, year and stage at diagnosis. Demographic and clinical data were compared by Fisher's exact test. Adjusted odds ratios for each site of metastasis or somatic variant were estimated using logistic regression with backwards stepwise AIC minimization. Cases with diagnosed metastases and available next generation somatic sequencing were included in the respective logistic regression models. Results: Patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were more likely to have masses in the B/T compared to control patients [51.6\% vs 31.0\%; p-value {$<$} 0.001]. After adjusting for age, sex, platinum-based chemotherapy, curative-intent surgical resection, and primary location, patients with BRCA1/2 PVs were less likely to develop peritoneal metastases compared to control patients (see table, row 3). Additionally, for patients with B/T masses, the rate of peritoneal spread was significantly lower in those with BRCA1/2PVs compared to those without (OR: 0.41 [0.20, 0.83]). We did not observe a significant association between BRCA1/2 PV and peritoneal spread in patients with HOP masses (OR: 1.09 [0.48, 2.5]). Furthermore, patients with BRCA1/2PVs were significantly less likely to have a TP53 mutation compared to controls (51\% vs 71\%; p = 0.038). This association persisted after adjusting for the variables described above (see table, row 3). No significant differences were found for mutations in KRAS (83\% vs 86\%; p = 0.60), SMAD4 (16\% vs 13\%; p = 0.59), or CDKN2A (19\% vs 29\%; p = 0.13). Conclusions: Our data suggest that patients with BRCA1/2-related PDAC are more likely to present with B/T masses compared to WT patients, are less likely to have TP53 mutations and are less likely to have peritoneal spread of disease. These data support that the prognostic benefit of BRCA-related PDAC may be linked to a favorable somatic mutation profile. ~	Liver	Lungs	Peritoneum	TP53 OR1 [CI] Group	1.64 [0.93, 2.95]	1.00 [0.61, 1.62]	0.79 [0.48, 1.28]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR2 [CI] Model 1 + Age, Sex, Platinum, Surgery	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.97 [0.59, 1.59]	0.76 [0.46, 1.24]	0.50 [0.25, 0.96] OR3 [CI] Model 2 + Primary Location	1.56 [0.84, 2.94]	0.92 [0.55, 1.50]	0.43 [0.21, 0.89]	0.25 [0.07, 0.74] P-value OR3	0.161	0.728	0.025	0.018 EXPAND TABLE OPEN IN VIEWER}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Early discontinuation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is common and leads to poor outcomes but is challenging to predict. In the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenetics trial, a high rate of early discontinuation due to intolerance was observed. We hypothesized that early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) predict AI discontinuation and that biochemical factors are associated with changes in PROs. PATIENTS AND METHODS Postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a prospective randomized trial of exemestane versus letrozole completed questionnaires at baseline and serially over 24 months to assess overall quality of life (EuroQOL Visual Analog Scale [VAS]); mood; and multiple symptoms, including a musculoskeletal symptom cluster. A joint mixed-effects/survival model was used to estimate the effect of the change in PROs on AI discontinuation. Associations between biochemical factors and change in PROs were examined. RESULTS A total of 490 patients were analyzed. Worsening of EuroQOL VAS and the musculoskeletal cluster were associated with the highest risk for early discontinuation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.77 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-2.81; p = .015]; HR, 4.39 [95\% CI, 2.40-8.02; p {\textbackslash}textless .0001], respectively). Pharmacokinetics and estrogen metabolism were not consistently associated with change in PRO measures. No clinically significant differences in any PRO between AIs were observed. CONCLUSION Changes in PROs early during AI therapy were associated with treatment discontinuation. Identification of these changes could be used to target interventions in patients at high risk for early discontinuation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Early changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can predict nonpersistence to aromatase inhibitor therapy. If used in clinical practice, PROs might identify women at highest risk for early discontinuation and allow for interventions to improve tolerance before significant toxicities develop. Further research is needed to improve capturing PROs in routine clinical practice.},

Such strategies that more closely mimic real practice, are known as dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs). A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a multi-stage trial design that can be used to construct effective DTRs. This article reviews a simple to use `weighted and replicated' estimation technique for comparing DTRs embedded in a SMART design using logistic regression for a binary, end-of-study outcome variable. Based on a Wald test that compares two embedded DTRs of interest from the `weighted and replicated' regression model, a sample size calculation is presented with a corresponding user-friendly applet to aid in the process of designing a SMART. The analytic models and sample size calculations are presented for three of the more commonly used two-stage SMART designs. Simulations for the sample size calculation show the empirical power reaches expected levels. A data analysis example with corresponding code is presented in the appendix using data from a SMART developing an effective DTR in autism.},

Inner-sphere redox reactions involve both changes in oxida-tion state and changes in bonding. Classically, in reactions such as the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) 1 reaction depicted in eqn (1a), the changes in oxidation state and those in bonding are co-localized: molybdenum is both oxidized and forms a new bond to oxygen, while nitrogen is reduced and the N--O bond is broken. Co-localization is not, however, obligatory. For example, in complexes with redox-active ligands, bonding changes may take place at a redox-inert metal center while the corresponding changes in oxidation state take place at the coordinated ligand (eqn (1b)). The most thoroughly studied example of such a ''non-classical'' inner-sphere redox reaction is proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), where the motion of the hydrogen nucleus may be quite separated from the motion of the electron. 2 In contrast to PCET, nonclassical OAT (eqn (1b)) would be a two-electron redox process. {\dh}1a{\TH}},

  abstract = {Policy implementation is a key component of scaling effective chronic disease prevention and management interventions. Policy can support scale-up by mandating or incentivizing intervention adoption, but enacting a policy is only the first step. Fully implementing a policy designed to facilitate implementation of health interventions often requires a range of accompanying implementation structures, like health IT systems, and implementation strategies, like training. Decision makers need to know what policies can support intervention adoption and how to implement those policies, but to date research on policy implementation is limited and innovative methodological approaches are needed. In December 2021, the Johns Hopkins ALACRITY Center for Health and Longevity in Mental Illness and the Johns Hopkins Center for Mental Health and Addiction Policy convened a forum of research experts to discuss approaches for studying policy implementation. In this report, we summarize the ideas that came out of the forum. First, we describe a motivating example focused on an Affordable Care Act Medicaid health home waiver policy used by some US states to support scale-up of an evidence-based integrated care model shown in clinical trials to improve cardiovascular care for people with serious mental illness. Second, we define key policy implementation components including structures, strategies, and outcomes. Third, we provide an overview of descriptive, predictive and associational, and causal approaches that can be used to study policy implementation. We conclude with discussion of priorities for methodological innovations in policy implementation research, with three key areas identified by forum experts: effect modification methods for making causal inferences about how policies' effects on outcomes vary based on implementation structures/strategies; causal mediation approaches for studying policy implementation mechanisms; and characterizing uncertainty in systems science models. We conclude with discussion of overarching methods considerations for studying policy implementation, including measurement of policy implementation, strategies for studying the role of context in policy implementation, and the importance of considering when establishing causality is the goal of policy implementation research.},

  abstract = {In the solid state, tris(3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholato)molybdenum(VI) forms a dimer with seven-coordinate molybdenum and bridging catecholates. NMR spectroscopy indicates that the dimeric structure is retained in solution. The molybdenum center has a high affinity for Lewis bases such as pyridine or pyridine-N-oxide, forming seven-coordinate monomers with a capped octahedral geometry, as illustrated by the solid-state structure of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(py). Structural data indicate that the complexes are best considered as Mo(VI) with substantial {$\pi$} donation from the nonbridging catecholates to molybdenum. Both the dimeric and the monomeric tris(catecholates) react rapidly with water to form free catechol and oxomolybdenum bis(catecholate) complexes. Monooxomolybdenum complexes are also obtained, more slowly, on reaction with dioxygen, with organic products consisting mostly of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone with minor amounts of the extradiol oxidation product 4,6-di-tert-butyl-1-oxacyclohepta-4,6-diene-2,3-dione. The pyridine-N-oxide complex reacts on heating (with excess pyO) to form initially (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy) and ultimately MoO3(Opy), with quinone and free pyridine as the only organic products. The decay of (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy) shows an accelerated, autocatalytic profile because the oxidation of its product, (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2MoO(Opy), produces an oxo-rich, catecholate-poor intermediate which rapidly conproportionates with (3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3Mo(Opy), providing an additional pathway for its conversion to the mono-oxo product. The tris(catecholate) fragment Mo(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)3 deoxygenates Opy in this nonclassical oxygen atom transfer reaction slightly less rapidly than does its oxidized product, MoO(3,5-(t)Bu2Cat)2.},

A dynamic treatment regimen (DTR) is a sequence of pre-specified decision rules which can be used to guide the delivery of a sequence of treatments or interventions that are tailored to the changing needs of the individual. The sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a research tool which allows for the construction of effective DTRs. SMARTs are multi-stage randomized trials in which some or all participants are randomized more than once, with each randomization corresponding to an open scientific question which will aid in the development of a high-quality DTR. In this dissertation, we develop a suite of tools which aid investigators in the design and analysis of SMARTs with continuous, longitudinal outcomes which are collected throughout the multiple stages of the trial.  We begin by deriving easy-to-use formulae for computing the total sample size for three common two-stage SMART designs in which the primary aim is to compare mean end-of-study outcomes for two embedded DTRs which recommend different first-stage treatments. The formulae are derived in the context of a regression model which leverages information from a longitudinal outcome collected over the entire study. We show that the sample size formula for a SMART can be written as the product of the sample size formula for a standard two-arm randomized trial, a deflation factor that accounts for the increased statistical efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation factor that accounts for the design of a SMART. The SMART design inflation factor is typically a function of the anticipated probability of response to first-stage treatment. We review modeling and estimation for DTR effect analyses using a longitudinal outcome from a SMART, as well as the estimation of standard errors. We also present estimators for the covariance matrix for a variety of common working correlation structures. Methods are motivated using the ENGAGE study, a SMART aimed at developing a DTR for increasing motivation to attend treatments among alcohol- and cocaine-dependent patients. Randomized trials are often constrained by limited financial resources; SMARTs are no different. The longitudinal deflation factor we develop allows for reduction in sample size requirements via both within-person correlation and the repeated measurements of the outcome over time. We provide guidance on how to balance sample size and the number of measurement occasions to minimize total cost of recruitment and measurement while achieving a target power. Finally, we introduce a procedure to generate data from a longitudinal SMART that will achieve an arbitrary desired covariance structure on potential outcomes, averaged over response status. This procedure, as well as user-friendly sample size tools which solve the cost optimization problems, are available in an R package called longsmart.},

As with a traditional randomized controlled trial, computing the minimum required sample size to achieve a desired power is a crucial step in designing an MRT. We present MRT-SS Calculator, an online sample-size calculator for micro-randomized trials, built with R Shiny. MRT-SS Calculator requires specification of time-varying patterns for the proximal treatment effect and expected treatment availability. We illustrate the implementation of MRTSS Calculator using a mobile health trial, HeartSteps. The application can be accessed from https://pengliao.shinyapps.io/mrt-calculator.},

  abstract = {There is a growing interest in leveraging the prevalence of mobile technology to improve health by delivering momentary, contextualized interventions to individuals' smartphones. A just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) adjusts to an individual's changing state and/or context to provide the right treatment, at the right time, in the right place. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) allow for the collection of data which aid in the construction of an optimized JITAI by sequentially randomizing participants to different treatment options at each of many decision points throughout the study. Often, these data are collected passively using a mobile phone. To assess the causal effect of treatment on a near-term outcome, care must be taken when designing the data collection system to ensure it is of appropriately high quality. Here, we make several recommendations for collecting and managing data from an MRT. We provide advice on selecting which features to collect and when, choosing between ``agents'' to implement randomization, identifying sources of missing data, and overcoming other novel challenges. The recommendations are informed by our experience with HeartSteps, an MRT designed to test the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing physical activity in sedentary adults. We also provide a checklist which can be used in designing a data collection system so that scientists can focus more on their questions of interest, and less on cleaning data.},

  abstract = {Health policy researchers often have questions about the effects of a policy implemented at some cluster-level unit, e.g., states, counties, hospitals, etc. on individual-level outcomes collected over multiple time periods. Stacked difference-in-differences is an increasingly popular way to estimate these effects. This approach involves estimating treatment effects for each policy-implementing unit, then, if scientifically appropriate, aggregating them to an average effect estimate. However, when individual-level data are available and non-implementing units are used as comparators for multiple policy-implementing units, data from untreated individuals may be used across multiple analyses, thereby inducing correlation between effect estimates. Existing methods do not quantify or account for this sharing of controls. Here, we describe a stacked difference-in-differences study investigating the effects of state medical cannabis laws on treatment for chronic pain management that motivated this work, discuss a framework for estimating and managing this correlation due to shared control individuals, and show how accounting for it affects the substantive results.},

  abstract = {Target trial emulation is an approach to designing rigorous nonexperimental studies by ``emulating'' key features of a clinical trial. Most commonly used outside of policy contexts, this approach is also valuable for policy evaluation as policies typically are not randomly assigned. In this article, we discuss the application of the target trial emulation framework in a policy evaluation context. The policy trial emulation framework includes 7 components: the units and eligibility criteria, definitions of the exposure and comparison conditions, assignment mechanism, baseline (``time zero'') and follow-up, outcomes, causal estimand, and statistical analysis and assumptions. Policy evaluations that emulate a randomized trial across these dimensions can yield estimates of the causal effects of the policy on outcomes. Using the policy trial emulation framework to conduct and report on research design and methods supports transparent assessment of threats to causal inference in nonexperimental studies intended to assess the effect of a health policy on clinical or population health outcomes.},

In this chapter, we relay lessons learned from the first MRT pilot study of HeartSteps, a JITAI intended to encourage sedentary adults to increase their physical activity by sending contextually-relevant, actionable activity suggestions and by supporting activity planning for the following day. This chapter outlines the lessons our study team learned from the HeartSteps pilot across four domains: (1) study recruitment and retention; (2) technical challenges in architecting a just-in-time adaptive intervention; (3) considerations of treatment delivery unique to JITAIs and MRTs; and (4) participant usage of and reflections on the HeartSteps study.},

Interviewees described the intensive process of agency integration and identified primarily positive (e.g., decreased administrative burden) impacts of integration. Quantitative analyses indicated no effects of integration on receipt of mental health-related services among people with co-occurring conditions. While leaders identified some potentially beneficial impacts of state agency integration, the limited impact of integration beyond the agency suggests that interventions at multiple levels of the service system, including those targeting providers, are needed to better meet the mental health service needs for this population.},
